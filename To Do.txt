Done:
user can select grids he wants to be as walls (by clicking on the map);
user can change the color of the wall (by hitting 0-7);
generate lower-level version ghosts that will move in one direction and once hits wall, will change direction. else, change direction with random chance (user can set);
generate higher-level version of ghosts that will trace will pacman is and move to hunt pacman with some algorithm (and user can set what algorithm he wants);
echo "game over" when ghost catches pacman

To-do:
implement power peels, user can put power peels on map;
whenever pacman eat power peels, all ghost can only move in one direction and only change direction when it hits wall ;
set up several different criteria to determine what is a game win, and the user can set it.
